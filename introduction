C++ Programming Language

Birth of C++ 

Initial Development:
Developer: Bjarne Stroustrup
Introduced: Early 1980s
Originally Named: “C with Classes”
Purpose: To add object-oriented features to C while retaining its efficiency and flexibility.

First Release:
Name Change: In 1983, "C with Classes" was officially renamed to "C++" to signify that it was an enhancement of C.
Version: The first commercial implementation was released in 1985.

-------------------------------------------------first program in c++----------------------------------------------------------

let’s start with a basic C++ program and walk through its components.
Here's a simple "Hello, World!" program in C++:
-------------------------------------------------
#include <iostream> 
int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl; 
    return 0; 
}
---------------------------------------------------


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() { 
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl; 
    return 0; 
}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) #include <iostream>:
This is a preprocessor directive that tells the compiler to include the standard input-output stream library. The iostream library provides functionalities for input and output operations in C++.

2)int main():
This is the main function where the execution of the program begins. The int indicates that the function will return an integer value. By convention, a return value of 0 typically signifies that the program completed successfully.

3) { ... }:
Curly braces {} are used to define the scope of the main function. All the code inside these braces is executed when the program runs.

4) std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;:
std::cout is an object used to handle output to the console. The << operator is used to send data to the output stream.
"Hello, World!" is a string literal that we want to print to the console.

std::endl is an I/O manipulator that inserts a newline character into the output stream and flushes the buffer.

5) return 0;:
This statement ends the main function and returns a value of 0 to the operating system. It signifies that the program has executed successfully
