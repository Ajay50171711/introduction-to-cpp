In C++, variables and data types are fundamental concepts that are crucial for programming. Understanding them is key to writing effective and efficient code.

To use a variable, you first need to declare it. The declaration tells the compiler what kind of data the variable will hold. The general syntax is:
data_type variable_name;

int age; // Declares a variable named 'age' of type 'int'

int age = 25; // Declares and initializes 'age' with the value 25


After declaring and initializing a variable, you can use it to store data, perform operations, and retrieve values. For example:
int a = 10;
int b = 20;
int sum = a + b; // 'sum' now holds the value 30

Fundamental Data Types
---------------------------

1)Integer Types:

int: Represents integer values. Size depends on the system but is commonly 4 bytes.
short: Represents smaller integers. Typically 2 bytes.
long: Represents larger integers. Typically 4 or 8 bytes, depending on the system.
long long: Represents very large integers. At least 8 bytes


2)Floating-Point Types:

float: Represents single-precision floating-point numbers. Typically 4 bytes.
double: Represents double-precision floating-point numbers. Typically 8 bytes.
long double: Represents extended precision floating-point numbers. Size and precision depend on the system but is often at least 8 bytes.


3)Character Types:

char: Represents a single character. Typically 1 byte.


4)Boolean Type:

bool: Represents boolean values true or false. Typically 1 byte.


Derived Data Types
------------------------------------------
Arrays:
Collections of elements of the same type. E.g., int arr[10];

Pointers:
Variables that store the memory address of another variable. E.g., int* ptr;

Functions:
Functions themselves can be treated as types. E.g., int (*func)(int, int);


User-Defined Data Types
--------------------------------
1)struct
2)union
3)class
